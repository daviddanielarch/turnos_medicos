# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Configuration

### API Host Configuration

The app needs to know where your Django backend API is running. You can configure this in several ways:

1. **Environment Variable (Recommended)**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST=http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. **App Configuration**: Update the `app.json` file in the `extra.apiHost` field:
   ```json
   {
     "expo": {
       "extra": {
         "apiHost": "http://localhost:8000"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Default Fallback**: If neither is configured, it defaults to `http://localhost:8000`

### Environment Variables

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST`: The base URL for your Django API backend
  - Development: `http://localhost:8000`
  - Production: `https://your-api-domain.com`

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure your API host (see Configuration section above)

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
